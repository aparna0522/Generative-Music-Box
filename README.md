# Generative-Music-Box
This project is done with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It regenerates the animation and the tones after specific interval of time and is very melodious to hear and sight to behold! The animation here is a circle with different colors and the tones are different notes of the musical keyboard(synthesizer).
